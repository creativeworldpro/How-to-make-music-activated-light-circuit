The project is about making music activated light circuit. We will make that circuit, the circuit can sync with music. The circuit is also able to react to the listener and the environment in real-time.

The included microphone that transmit to sound to the light.

The AC bulb light can hear sound and music nearby and will dance to the rhythm. In this way as long as the microphone works properly and the music mode on the bulbs is turned on, the music sync AC bulb lights will pulsate to the rhythm.


To make this music light circuit, we might need some electronics component. Those component lists have to been given below.

Feature of BC-547

The BC547 is widely used general-purpose NPN bipolar junction transistor.

1.	Suitable for use in low-noise amplification circuit

2.	DC current gain ranging from 110 to 800

3.	Low voltage drop, typically around 0.7v

5.	Maximum collector-emitter voltage rating of 45V

6.	BC547 is also available in TO-92, SOT-23 and SOT-223 package.


Connect BC547 With C1815 Transistor -

To make this music activated light circuit, 1st we need to connect both transistor "Emitter" leg. Then connect C1815 transistor "Collector" leg with "Base" leg of BC547 transistor.


Connect Resistor with the Circuit -

Now we connect resistor with the circuit. We connect 1 MΩ resistor one terminal with "Source" leg of BT-136 triac and the resistor other terminal with "Base" leg of C1815 transistor. Again connect 10 KΩ resistor with "Gate" leg of BT-136 triac.


Connect Capacitor with the Circuit -

This time we connect 10µf/ 25v capacitor positive leg with 10 KΩ resistor and the capacitor negative terminal with "Base" leg of C1815 transistor. Next connect 100 KΩ resistor with "Gate" leg of BT-136 triac and it's other terminal with "Collector leg of C1815 transistor.

Then connect BT-136 triac "T1" leg with "Collector" leg of BC547 transistor.


Connect MIC with the Circuit -

Since it is music activated light circuit, for that we need to connect audio signal receiver with the circuit. For audio signal receiver we are using MIC to make this circuit. We connect MIC positive terminal with 10µf/ 25v capacitor positive leg and MIC negative terminal with "Emitter" leg of BC547 transistor.


Connect holder and AC cable with the Circuit -

To connect AC bulb, we need to connect a bulb holder with the circuit. There are two terminal at a bulb holder. We connect one terminal with "T1" leg of BT-136 triac.

Now we need to connect AC cable with the circuit. We connect AC cable one terminal with "T2" leg of BT-136 triac. 
Then connect the rest terminal of bulb holder and AC cable.

Please remember that, we might need to use separator for safety purpose only.


Connect DC Power with the Circuit -

This time we need to connect a DC power supply with the circuit. For DC power supply, we are using DC-9v.

 We connect DC-9v positive cable with "Gate" leg of BT-136 triac and connect DC-9v negative cable with "Emitter" leg of BC547 transistor.


Soldering And Cleaning -

Neat and perfect soldering is an important part for all kind of PCBs. Since soldering, you should remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit connection. After soldering all leg, we cut-off the extra leg of all electronics component.
We also can use liquid PCB cleaner to clean the PCB board.


Final Action - 

Our circuit is completely ready for use now. We need to power switch ON and put audio source beside MIC. Then play music and enjoy the awesome effect of filament bulb. 

Again thanks to JLCPCB for best quality PCBs.
